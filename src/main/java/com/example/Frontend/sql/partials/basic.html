<h2>Basic SQL Queries</h2>
<p>
Structured Query Language (SQL) provides a set of commands to interact with the data stored in relational databases. These commands allow you to retrieve, insert, update, and delete records. 
They form the foundation of working with databases and are essential for developers, analysts, and database administrators alike.
</p>

<h3>1. Retrieving Data — SELECT</h3>
<p>
The <code>SELECT</code> statement is used to fetch data from one or more tables. You can retrieve all columns or only specific ones, and filter results based on conditions.
</p>
<pre>
-- Retrieve all columns from the "users" table
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Retrieve specific columns (name and email)
SELECT name, email FROM users;

-- Retrieve only active users
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Retrieve users sorted by registration date (newest first)
SELECT * FROM users
ORDER BY registration_date DESC;
</pre>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use <code>LIMIT</code> to restrict the number of results returned, especially with large datasets.</p>

<h3>2. Adding Data — INSERT</h3>
<p>
The <code>INSERT</code> statement is used to add new rows into a table. You can insert a single row or multiple rows in one statement.
</p>
<pre>
-- Insert one row into the "users" table
INSERT INTO users (name, age, email)
VALUES ('John Doe', 30, 'john@example.com');

-- Insert multiple rows at once
INSERT INTO users (name, age, email)
VALUES 
('Jane Smith', 25, 'jane@example.com'),
('Alex Brown', 28, 'alex@example.com');
</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Always specify the column names to avoid errors if the table structure changes in the future.</p>

<h3>3. Updating Data — UPDATE</h3>
<p>
The <code>UPDATE</code> statement modifies existing rows in a table. It’s important to include a <code>WHERE</code> clause to avoid updating every row unintentionally.
</p>
<pre>
-- Update a single user's age
UPDATE users
SET age = 31
WHERE name = 'John Doe';

-- Give a 10% salary increase to all employees in the "Engineering" department
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE department = 'Engineering';
</pre>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Without a <code>WHERE</code> clause, the update will apply to every row in the table.</p>

<h3>4. Deleting Data — DELETE</h3>
<p>
The <code>DELETE</code> statement removes one or more rows from a table. As with <code>UPDATE</code>, always use a <code>WHERE</code> clause unless you intend to remove all data.
</p>
<pre>
-- Delete users younger than 18
DELETE FROM users
WHERE age &lt; 18;

-- Delete all orders that have been cancelled
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE status = 'cancelled';
</pre>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use <code>TRUNCATE TABLE</code> to quickly remove all data from a table — it’s faster but cannot be rolled back in some databases.</p>

<h3>5. Filtering Results — WHERE</h3>
<p>
The <code>WHERE</code> clause allows you to filter data based on conditions. It supports operators such as <code>=</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>LIKE</code>, and <code>IN</code>.
</p>
<pre>
-- Find users with age over 25
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE age &gt; 25;

-- Find users whose name starts with "A"
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

-- Find orders placed by specific customers
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE customer_id IN (101, 102, 103);
</pre>

<h3>6. Sorting Results — ORDER BY</h3>
<pre>
-- Sort users by name in ascending order
SELECT * FROM users
ORDER BY name ASC;

-- Sort users by age in descending order
SELECT * FROM users
ORDER BY age DESC;
</pre>

<h3>7. Limiting Results — LIMIT / OFFSET</h3>
<pre>
-- Retrieve only the first 10 rows
SELECT * FROM products
LIMIT 10;

-- Retrieve rows 11 to 20
SELECT * FROM products
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
</pre>

<h3>8. Combining Filters</h3>
<pre>
-- Find all active users above age 25
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE status = 'active' AND age &gt; 25;

-- Find all products in category 5 OR priced under $50
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE category_id = 5 OR price &lt; 50;
</pre>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
These basic SQL queries form the foundation of database interaction. By mastering them, you’ll be able to perform most day-to-day database operations. 
As you progress, you’ll learn more advanced topics like <strong>JOINs</strong>, <strong>GROUP BY</strong>, <strong>subqueries</strong>, <strong>aggregate functions</strong>, and <strong>transactions</strong> that allow you to handle more complex scenarios.
